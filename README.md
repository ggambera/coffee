#### Functionality
* Be sure that we can get the code to run without issues by following the instructions in the README file

* Be sure your code is readable and well structured
* If including a user-interactive feature like a search field, be sure that you appropriately handle error cases
* Be thoughtful about what type of styling is used (example: font-sizes are not too small or large, colors are not too dark/light to be easily seen, etc.)
